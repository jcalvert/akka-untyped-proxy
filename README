A quick and dirty and alpha library written by someone who read about Akka two days ago.

The idea is pretty simple: wrap existing legacy code with proxies to utilize the concurrency provided by the activeobject pattern.
For very procedural, long running code, this could give serious speed boost.

Known issues not handled gracefully: 
Does not play well with primitive or final return types. 

Things to do: 
all the beautiful Akka control/registry stuff
cache the proxy factories
Come with a scenario that provides some real tests
